    <h2>History of Choicenames</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Choicenames began as the passion project of <strong>Layton</strong>, a one-man web pioneer who built the entire site back in the early 90s using <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, a pinch of <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and a single <strong>SQL table</strong>. That's right — no frameworks, no teams, just raw code and vision.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Layton wasn’t just selling domain names — he was crafting a whole vibe. The original site looked like you were using a <strong>Palm Pilot</strong> — complete with a stylus-style interface. It was quirky, creative, and ahead of its time. Here's a sneak peek:

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PalmPilot" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 underline">What’s a Palm Pilot?</a>
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Today, Choicenames is being lovingly rebuilt by a friend — that's me — as a modern homage to Layton’s original masterpiece. We're talking <strong>Django</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong>, <strong>GitHub CI/CD</strong>, and all the modern web goodness... but still keeping it charmingly minimal and no-fuss.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      This site is a <em>pitstop of nostalgia</em> and a <strong>functioning digital shop</strong> where you can still find and buy unique domain names. It’s proof that two engineers, separated by decades in tooling but united by heart and code, can make something timeless — and useful.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-6 font-semibold">We hope you enjoy this little time capsule turned modern web service.</p>
