        Remember when the internet was a wild.wild.west of <strong>blinking text</strong>, <strong>dial-up tones</strong>, and <strong>"you’ve got mail"</strong>? A place where everyone had a <em>GeoCities page</em>, and your online status was basically your personality?

      <!-- 2. What Even Is a Domain Name? -->
      <h2 class="mb-2">So… what’s a domain name?</h2>
      <p>
        A domain is your <strong>digital front door</strong>. It’s the name you type to get somewhere — like <strong>amazon.com</strong> or <strong>neopets.com</strong>. But it’s more than that. It’s <em>identity</em>. It’s <em>brand</em>. It’s <strong>power</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the early days, the internet was wide open. And domains? They were like <strong>plots of land</strong> — just waiting for someone to claim them.

      <!-- 3. The Gold Rush -->
      <h2 class="mb-2">The Great Domain Gold Rush</h2>
      <p>Back in the 90s and early 2000s, people started grabbing domain names like they were panning for gold. The smart ones saw the future — and locked in some true gems.</p>
      <p>
        Names like <strong>voice.com</strong> sold for <strong>$30 million</strong>. Others were short, snappy, or just... weirdly perfect. And some are still around.
      </p>
      <p class="italic text-gray-700">Most of us missed that wave. But a few were right there in the thick of it.</p>

      <!-- 4. We Got Lucky (or Smart) -->
      <h2 class="mb-2">We Were There Too.</h2>
      <p>Our collection? Built during that wild time. A handful of original, hand-registered domains that somehow never got scooped up or forgotten.</p>
      <p>Here are just a few names still in the vault:</p>
      <ul class="featured-domains">
        <li>
          <strong>aerialphotography.net</strong> — like your dad’s hobby site in 1999, now reimagined as a drone SaaS brand
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>multimediatech.com</strong> — the perfect throwback name for a modern content studio or streaming brand
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>r-x.net</strong> — short, edgy, hacker-vibes. Could be a dev tool, data API, or underground newsletter
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>webxing.com</strong> — sounds like a digital skate park or indie platform for online creators
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>dataencryption.net</strong> — feels like early 2000s infosec… or your next zero-trust startup
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>holomapping.com</strong> — AR, VR, XR? This could be your map to the metaverse
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>nanobotic.net</strong> — cyberpunk biotech? Or a fake company from a 90s sci-fi thriller?
        </li>
      </ul>

        These domains are more than names. They’re pieces of internet history —
